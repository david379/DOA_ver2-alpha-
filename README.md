# DOA_ver2-alpha-
Implemented multiprocessing

This version of the code contains multiprocessing in the "test.py" file. It obtains real time results, but you have to be careful while running it. Because of the multiprocessing, the calculation now has to happen in a "main" file and not inside a function, so to obtain the DOA, run the "test" file.
